# cybersecuritybase_project

A course project with several [cyber security flaws](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

### How to start
- Run `python 3 manage.py migrate` to create a database named db.sqlite3.
- Run `python 3 manage.py runserver` to start the app in http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
- Click the "register" link, go to the regstration page and create two accounts. (Two account are needed because you need to login using one account and send messages to another.)
